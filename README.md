MATLAB scripts for estimating the position of a monkey hand given neuronal firing patterns from its motor cortex. LSTM approach - LSTM classifer to determine the inital angle, use angle to select a pair of LSTMs to perform time-series regression and estimate the hand movements. MSE around 25, could probably get lower by grid searching hyperparameters
